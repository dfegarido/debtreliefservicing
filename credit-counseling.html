                <h2>What is credit counseling?</h2>
                <p>Credit counseling is a service designed to help consumers find solutions to common financial challenges.</p>
                <p>Alternatively known as consumer credit counseling, debt counseling, and debt & budget counseling, credit counseling can help you learn how to manage overwhelming debt, poor credit, budget deficits and more. These counseling conversations are always kept confidential and focus on meeting you where you are, developing a plan to meet your financial goals and achieve credit card debt relief.</p>
                <p>Debt Relief Servicing is a nonprofit credit counseling and financial education company with NFCC-certified counselors. We take the time to thoroughly review your budget, discuss your concerns, and provide specific advice on how to reach your unique goals. Best of all, we offer credit counseling for free, 24/7.</p>

                <h2>How does credit counseling work?</h2>
                <p>Credit counseling is a great way to step back and get clarity on your financial situation. During your session, we'll review your income, expenses, and debts in detail to create a complete picture of where your money is going. It's helpful to have your most recent bills and statements on hand so that we can get a better understanding of what your current situation looks like.</p>
                <p>Next, we discuss your current goals and long-term financial plans, providing unbiased suggestions and resources designed to help you reach those goals. Through our credit counseling services, we'll provide the support and practical advice you need to make lifelong changes to your financial outlook and get out of debt.</p>
                <p>The initial counseling session usually takes less than an hour to complete over the phone, or as little as 15 minutes online. During this session, we can help you create a budget and share options for eliminating debt. You can complete your free credit counseling session online, over the phone, or even in-person in select locations.</p>
