                <h2>What is a debt management plan?</h2>
                <p>A debt management plan (DMP) is a structured debt repayment program that doesn't require a loan and is typically administered by a nonprofit credit counseling agency, such as Debt Relief Servicing. When you start a debt management plan, Debt Relief Servicing reviews your current debt and budget and then works closely with creditors to reduce your interest rates and find a single monthly payment that fits your budget. <a href="#">Learn more about what a debt management plan is and how it could benefit you.</a></p>

                <h2>What is unique about a debt management plan?</h2>
                <ul class="dmp-unique">
                    <li><strong>Debt consolidation with no credit requirement</strong>. A DMP helps you simplify and accelerate your debt repayment no matter your current credit score.</li>
                    <li><strong>Administered by nonprofit organizations</strong>. Because most DMPs are provided by nonprofit credit counseling agencies, they're designed to offer you the support, education and tools to get out of debt and stay out of debt. Nonprofit debt management plans are tailored to your needs (not ours) to best support you on your way to financial freedom.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repayment in as little as 24 months</strong>. Most debt management plans are designed to be completed in five years or less. This allows you to get control of your debt much faster than continuing to pay the minimum on your own.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced interest and major savings</strong>. We work with your creditors to negotiate reduced interest rates while on a DMP, resulting in significant savings by the time you're paid off. While there are no free debt management plans, the investment is small compared to the savings you receive when you pay off your debt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Paid in full and ready for your next big goal</strong>. By paying your debts in full, the debt management plan helps you rebuild your credit and prepare for whatever comes next.</li>
